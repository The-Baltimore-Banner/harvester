AP Harvester
============

AP Harvester is an open source, collaborative data collection platform designed
to help newsrooms gather structured data at the speed of news. We built it to
lower the barriers in spinning up a new data collection project so that you can
get to the story faster.

AP Harvester is schema-driven, meaning you define the structure of the dataset
you want to collect and Harvester automatically renders a user-friendly form
through which a team of repoters can enter data as they collect it. It's built
to be flexible and transparent, allowing you to adapt as your data collection
needs change.

AP Harvester uses Google Sheets as a data storage mechanism, meaning you can
easily view and work with your data in a tool used by many newsrooms already.
Starting a new data collection project with AP Harvester is as easy creating
a new spreadsheet.

## Credit

This project has been a labor of love for the AP Data Team and we can't wait to
see what you do with it! If you do decide develop your own fork and take it in
your own direction we would really appreciate it if you kept a shout-out to the
Associated Press in your version of the tool.

Happy harvesting!
