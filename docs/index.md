AP Harvester
============

AP Harvester is an open source, collaborative data collection platform designed
to help newsrooms gather structured data at the speed of news. We built it to
lower the barriers in spinning up a new data collection project so that you can
get to the story faster.

AP Harvester is schema-driven, meaning you define the structure of the dataset
you want to collect and Harvester automatically renders a user-friendly form
through which a team of reporters can enter data as they collect it. It's built
to be flexible and transparent, allowing you to adapt as your data collection
needs change.

The current iteration of AP Harvester uses Google Sheets as a data storage
mechanism, meaning you can view and work with your data in a tool used by many
newsrooms already. Starting a new data collection project with AP Harvester is
as easy [creating a new spreadsheet][sheet-new].
