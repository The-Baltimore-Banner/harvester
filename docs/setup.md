Setting up your own Harvester
=============================

There are several different ways you can deploy your very own Harvester.
Because the project is open source, you can take the code and run it directly
on a server; you can also run our freely available Docker container or build
your own Docker container using the Dockerfile included in the project; or you
deploy Harvester directly to [Heroku][] at the click of a button.

Before you dive into deploying the code, you first need to set up some Google
credentials for the tool to use, no matter how you deploy it.

## Google Credentials

Since AP Harvester relies on Google Sheets for data storage, the first step in
setting up your own Harvester is [creating a Google service account for the
tool to use][create-service-account]. This is the account that Harvester will
use to read and write Google Sheets, so each sheet you create to start a new
Harvester project will need to be shared with this account as an editor. (When
sharing a Google Sheet with a service account it's a good idea to uncheck the
"Notify people" box, because if you don't then you might get an email
bounce-back telling you the notification couldn't be delivered; that's not
a problem, but it can be annoying.) Once you've created the service account you
will get a set of credentials in a JSON file. You should keep those credentials
safe in your records for future use, but we'll be using them when we deploy the
app shortly.

The next step is to [create a Google OAuth client][create-oauth] to allow users
to sign into Harvester using their Google accounts. This is technically
optional, but it is strongly recommended unless you want every Harvester
project to be available to everyone who has access to the app. Still, there are
advantages to enabling authentication, like automatically tracking which users
have entered data. While you are setting up your Google OAuth consent screen
for the application you will need to include the following scopes:

* `auth/userinfo.email`

* `auth/userinfo.profile`

We'll use the OAuth client ID and client secret shortly when we deploy the app.

## Deploying to Heroku

[Heroku][] is an app deployment platform that will host and run your deployment
of AP Harvester for free, provided you don't exceed certain usage limits. It
can be a convenient way to escape the hassle of managing server infrastructure
yourself, especially if you want to spin up your own version of Harvester to
see if it's right for you. You will need to [create a Heroku
account][heroku-create-account] if you don't already have one.

Once you've created and signed in to your Heroku account and you're ready to
deploy your very own Harvester, click on the button below. (It might be helpful
to open the link in a new tab so you can still reference these instructions.)

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/associatedpress/harvester)

The link will take you to a page to configure your new app in Herokuâ€™s
dashboard. First, you need to give your app a name. This name will be included
in the URL of your Harvester, so try to pick something informative. An
abbreviation of your newsroom along with the word "harvester" might be a good
choice, like `tmp-harvester` or `khn-harvester`; you'll end up with a URL like
[https://khn-harvester.herokuapp.com](https://khn-harvester.herokuapp.com).

Next, scroll down to the "Config vars" section, where you should see entry
fields where you can set values for things like
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and more. If you
created a Google OAuth client then go ahead and paste in your client ID and
client secret in the fields marked `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and
`GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, respectively; if you don't want to use
authentication you can leave those two fields blank, but again, we recommend
taking the time to set it up. Paste you Google service account credentials
(that JSON you downloaded when setting up your service account) into the field
marked `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS`.

If you want to [set up your Harvester instance with a configuration
sheet][configuration-sheet], you can paste [the spreadsheet's
ID][google-spreadsheet-id] into the field marked
`HARVESTER_CONFIG_RESOURCE_ID`. This is optional, but setting up a Harvester
configuration sheet will allow you to create custom URLs for your Harvester
projects, so it can be nice to have.

Once you've entered all your configuration information you can hit the "Deploy
app" button at the bottom of the page and Heroku should start building and
deploying your app. This will take a few minutes, but Heroku should tell you
what it's doing as it goes through the process. If all goes well, you should
see a message like "Your app was successfully deployed" and you should see two
links: "Manage app", which will take you to the Heroku dashboard for your newly
created Harvester app; and "View", which will take you to Harvester itself!
When you click the "View" button it should take you to the URL of your
Harvester instance (e.g.,
[https://ap-harvester.herokuapp.com](https://ap-harvester.herokuapp.com)) and
you should see the Harvester landing page.

At this point it would be a good idea to [set up a simple Harvester
project][first-project] to
make sure that all your credentials are working as expected.

## Deploying directly or with Docker

Heroku is great, but it's not for everyone. Maybe your newsroom already has
a preferred environment for running apps and you would prefer to run Harvester
there. In that case you should probably start by checking out the development
documentation to see how to run the app, build a Docker container, and get the
app running on your own.
